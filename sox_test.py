Internal Controls Policy

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls 
over financial reporting (ICFR). The CEO and CFO must certify the effectiveness 
of these controls quarterly.

Our control framework is based on the COSO framework and includes:
1. Control environment with tone at the top
2. Risk assessment processes for fraud detection
3. Control activities and procedures
4. Information and communication systems
5. Monitoring activities and testing

The audit committee oversees the external auditor and reviews material weaknesses.
All employees can report concerns through our anonymous whistleblower hotline.
Documentation of all controls is maintained and updated regularly.

We have some controls in place but they're not really documented.
Management does what they think is best.
Financial reports are prepared by whoever is available.
