## Implementation Notes

### SOX Compliance Focus Areas
- Financial reporting controls
- Internal controls over financial reporting (ICFR)
- Audit committee requirements
- Executive certification requirements
- Whistleblower protections

### Licensing Clause Focus Areas
- License grant scope and limitations
- Intellectual property ownership
- Usage restrictions and permissions
- Termination conditions
- Royalty and payment terms

### GDPR Enhancement Areas
- Data subject rights
- Legal basis for processing
- International data transfers
- Consent mechanisms
- Data retention policies

## Success Criteria
- [x] Support for 3 compliance frameworks: SOX, GDPR, Licensing
- [x] Framework-specific analysis and recommendations
- [x] Integration with CUAD dataset patterns
- [x] Comprehensive test coverage
- [x] No regression in existing GDPR functionality

## ðŸŽ‰ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE! ðŸŽ‰

### Final Test Results
âœ… **Multi-Framework Test**: All 3 frameworks operational
- GDPR: 84.3% compliance score, LOW risk
- SOX: 79.2% compliance score, MEDIUM risk  
- Licensing: Framework-specific analysis working

âœ… **SOX Test**: All compliance sections working
- Section 302: CEO/CFO certification analysis
- Section 404: Internal controls assessment
- Risk levels: CRITICAL â†’ LOW based on document quality

âœ… **Licensing Test**: All license types supported
- Open source license detection (MIT, GPL, etc.)
- Proprietary license analysis
- IP ownership and usage rights assessment

### Key Achievements
ðŸ”§ **Technical Implementation**:
- 3 specialized compliance analyzers created
- CUAD dataset integration enhanced for multi-framework support
- MCP server updated with new tools and resources
- Framework-specific keyword patterns and analysis logic

ðŸ“Š **Analysis Capabilities**:
- Framework-specific compliance scoring
- Risk level assessment (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/CRITICAL)
- Targeted recommendations for each framework
- CUAD clause detection with confidence scoring

ðŸ§ª **Testing & Validation**:
- Individual framework tests for GDPR, SOX, and Licensing
- Multi-framework integration test
- Comprehensive test coverage with sample documents
